Discontinued in favor of helping ItzWarty with The Dargon Project: http://www.itzwarty.com/

I thought it for a long while, and decided there was no point in developing two competing applications. That being said, I am working to integrate the features of SIU into Dargon as well as add new features. We're hoping to push some major content changes before the new year, some of which include:

  * Many internal upgrades that will help efficiency and lower memory cost
  * Installing custom skins over a certain RIOT skin
  * Changing recommended items
  * Custom text editing
  * The start of a data mining engine


Installs/uninstalls custom skin modifications of the League of Legends game. Also has multiple tools to allow for the creation of said modifications
